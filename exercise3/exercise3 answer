Q: Change the kernel sizes for all the filters with all different values for noises and print the results for 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 kernels. Comment on the results. Which filter seems to work ”better” for images with salt-and-pepper noise and gaussian noise?
A:
As the kernal size increases, the images become more blur;
Median filter works better for images with salt-and-pepper noise;
Gaussian filter works better for images with gaussian noise.
